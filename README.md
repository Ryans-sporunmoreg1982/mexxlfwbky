Man, just finished watching Drop and I swear, I've got thoughts swirling all over the place. It's like when you're halfway through a dream that makes total sense while you're in it, but you wake up and you’re like, “What the hell was that?”

First off, who on earth comes up with these characters? It’s like a train wreck of personalities, trying to out-weird each other, but in a strangely captivating way. Seriously, what’s with that lead guy? He's got this brooding thing going, but then he gets all existential, and it's like, dude, chill out, maybe get a latte AND a therapist. Lol.

> The soundtrack though, just wow. It’s like each song was specifically designed to underscore just how bizarre the previous scene was. Like, thanks, music people, I really needed those heavy bass beats thumping as I question my own existence. And the plot twists, my God. They’re like riding a roller coaster, with a blindfold on, during an earthquake. You literally have no idea which way it’s gonna flip next.

Anyway, I had to download the movie before watching it 'cause, I mean, who even goes to theaters anymore with all those sticky floors and overpriced popcorn, right? All about that sofa life. Even so, my brain feels just as mashed as it would after sitting in one of those creaky cinema seats, grappling with whatever that ending was supposed to mean.

You know what I mean? The whole thing’s like trying to read a novel in a foreign language you only kinda know. You get bits, but you’re probably missing some huge subplot about the socio-political underpinnings of the third act, or whatever.

And the dialog, whew, dripping with irony and sarcasm that would make even a millennial proud. It's like every character’s whispering, Don't take me too seriously, while proclaiming some grand insight into the human condition.

var whyDidIWriteThis = JavaScript is weird.;
 
Then again, maybe I'm just too tired to process it all correctly. I need to watch the movie again when I'm less zombified, maybe catch some nuances I missed. But who am I kidding? I'll probably just end up watching cat videos on YouTube instead. Priorities, right?
